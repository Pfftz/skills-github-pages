title: Smurf Cat

Smurf Cat is a viral meme that has taken over TikTok and other social media platforms. It is a blue cat-like creature with the facial features of a cat and a mushroom hat.

The image was created in 2014 by artist Nate Hallinan and was originally called "Smurf Sighting." The meme has become so popular that it has its own TikTok hashtag with over 800 million views.

The Smurf Cat meme has also inspired other sub-memes, such as "I see that damn Smurf Cat everywhere." The meme has become a cultural phenomenon, but it is important to note that it has no relation to the Smurfs franchise.
